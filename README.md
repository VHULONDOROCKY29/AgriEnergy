Farmers can add products to their profiles on the Agri-Energy online program, which is a stock management website.
 Employees can examine all products uploaded by each farmer. 
 Users can add new farms to the database and filter data by date range or commodity category. 
 The website has a simple, minimalistic design and is easy to use. Users must enter admin details and select the "Employees" option in order to access the website. Farmers may see their products, sort them by kind or date range, and edit information like price and quantity after logging in.
  For protection, every password on the website is hashed. 
  To maintain data accuracy, farmers can update and add new items, but they cannot be removed.
